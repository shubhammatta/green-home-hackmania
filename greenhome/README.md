- **AI-powered Dashboard:** Gain insights into your energy consumption patterns.
- **Tailored Recommendations:** Receive personalized tips to improve energy efficiency.
- **Cost-effective:** A pure software solution that doesn't require expensive IoT home sensors.



## Future Plans

Our post-MVP roadmap includes:

- Multi-appliance bulk processing with video input.
- Integration with SP's My Carbon Footprint for a holistic view of environmental impact.
- AI tuning improvements for enhanced prediction accuracy.
- Expansion to water consumption habits for comprehensive utility optimization.
- Increased marketing efforts to encourage user participation.

### Vision

Our vision is to become the go-to app for building efficient utilities consumption habits in Singapore, eventually expanding our reach to empower users worldwide to live more sustainably.
